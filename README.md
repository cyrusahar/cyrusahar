# 👋 Hi, I’m @cyrusahar

## 👀 I’m interested in ...
- Cybersecurity (because who doesn’t love a good mystery?)
- Ethical hacking (I promise I only break things with permission!)
- Network security (keeping my Wi-Fi safer than my love life)
- Penetration testing (not as spicy as it sounds, I swear!)
- Security research (or as I like to call it, “Where did I put my laptop?”)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Cybersecurity fundamentals (like, "Don't click that link!")
- Python for cybersecurity (because what’s scarier than a snake in your code?)
- Web application security (making sure your cat video site is safe from hackers)
- Network protocols (basically the secret handshake of the internet)

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- Open-source security tools (let’s build something cooler than my last haircut)
- Vulnerability assessments (no, not about my dating life)
- Security awareness projects (because everyone needs a “Don’t be an idiot online” guide)
- Research on emerging cybersecurity threats (like my neighbor’s new Wi-Fi name)

## 📫 How to reach me ...
- Email: [cyrusnike@proton.me](mailto:cyrusnike@proton.me)

## 😄 Pronouns: ...
- They/Them (and yes, they are as cool as they sound)

## ⚡ Fun fact: ...
- I once tried to hack my own Wi-Fi password and accidentally locked myself out. (True story!)
